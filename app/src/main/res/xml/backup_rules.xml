   Backup rules for Khawchin Weather App (API < 31)
   See https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup
   
   SECURITY: Exclude sensitive/device-specific data from backup:
   - FCM tokens (device-specific)
   - User IDs (regenerated on new device)
   - Location data (privacy)
   - Cached weather (will refresh)

    <!-- Include user preferences (theme, language, units) -->
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="khawchin_settings.preferences_pb" />
    
    <!--
        Note: With specific <include> rules above, only the included paths are backed up.
        No need to explicitly exclude other paths as they are not included by default.
